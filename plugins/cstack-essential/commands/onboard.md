$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Your job is to "onboard" yourself to the current task.

Do this by:

- Using ultrathink
- Exploring the codebase
- Asking me questions if needed

The goal is to get you fully prepared to start working on the task.

Take as long as you need to get yourself ready. Overdoing it is better than underdoing it.

Record everything in a .claude/tasks/[TASK_NAME]/onboarding.md file. This file will be used to onboard you to the task in a new session if needed, so make sure it's comprehensive.
